# Introduction
**Growly** is a platform where people exchange knowledge directly.  
Teach something you know, learn something you want — no payments, no barriers, only skill sharing.

---

# What is Growly?
Growly was born from the idea that **knowledge should flow freely**. Instead of money, the "currency" here is what you know.  
- Do you play guitar and want to learn programming?  
- Are you a designer looking to improve your English?  
- Or maybe you know math but want to practice cooking?  

With Growly, you can **offer a skill you already have** and in return **learn something new** from another member of the community.  

It’s a **peer-to-peer exchange of skills**, where everyone is both a teacher and a learner.  

---

# How it works
1. **Create your profile**  
   Add the skills you can teach and the ones you want to learn.  

2. **Find matches**  
   Browse people with complementary skills: someone who wants to learn what you know, and knows what you want to learn.  

3. **Connect & exchange**  
   Schedule a session (online or in person), and start sharing knowledge.  

4. **Grow together**  
   There’s no money involved — only collaboration, community, and growth.

# Why Growly?
- **Accessible** → No financial cost, open to everyone.  
- **Community-driven** → Built around trust, mutual respect, and shared learning.  
- **Motivating** → Teaching reinforces your own knowledge, while learning expands your horizons.
